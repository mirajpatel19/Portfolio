# Miraj Patel's Portfolio

Here are the projects that I have worked on outside of school and work. Projects below consist of Data Exploration, Web Scraping, Machine Learning, and Tableau.

## ▣ Machine Learning

**Salary Predictions**<br />

## ▣ Exploratory Analysis

**TMDB 5000 Movies**<br />
[Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mirajpatel19/Portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Data%20Exploratory/IMDB%20Movies%20-%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)<br />
The main purpose of this project, 'IMDB Movies' was to perform data exploration and determined what makes a movie blockbuster. Along the way, I answer questions that I come across while doing data exploration such as what is average profit for the most profitable movies? what are the languages of the most profitable movies?, what is average budget for profitable movies? and what is the average duration of top 5 most profitable movie? In the end, I am able to predict what qualities makes a movie blockbuster. For a movie to be a blockbuster it must have genres as either drama, comedy, thriller, action, or adventure. Some of these casts such as Samuel L. Jackson, Robert De Niro, Bruce Willis, Matt Damon, and Morgan Freeman. The average runtime should be around 111 minutes. The movie must be in these languages: English, Français, Español, Deutsch, and Pусский. The average budget must be around 43 million dollars. It a movie has all of those things, on average the movie will have a profit of around 111 million dollars.<br />

**TED Talks**<br />
[Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mirajpatel19/Portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Data%20Exploratory/TED%20Talks%20-%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)<br />
This is my first data exploratory project. I had to learn many new things while working on this project. Big thanks and the credit goes to Rounak Banik for the inspiration. In this project I answer question such as, most funny TED Talks show, with what occupation can you increase you chances of being a TED Talk speaker, most inspiring TED Talks show, is there any correlation between languages and views, what TED Event has the most amount of TED Talks publish on the website, and many more. I also Analyze TED talks by years, months, and days.<br />

**Titanic**<br />
[Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mirajpatel19/Portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Data%20Exploratory/Titanic%20-%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)<br />
By doing exploratory analysis of Titanic dataset we can conclude that, gender played a big role into who survive and who does not. In fact, female had 74 percent chance of surviving compared to 19 percent for male. Another factor was Pclass, which is the ticket class. There were three classes we had to analyze. We found that people in 3rd class had the highest chance of surviving followed by 1st and 2nd class. Female also had the highest rate of survival in all three classes compared to males.<br />
*Fun Fact:Titanic dataset was not the first dataset I actually worked on. Majority of beginner actually start learning on the dataset.*<br />  

**NBA Stats - Los Angeles Lakers**<br />
[Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mirajpatel19/Portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Data%20Exploratory/NBA%20Stats%20-%20Los%20Angeles%20Lakers.ipynb)<br />
The main purpose of this project was to perform data exploration and find best 3-Point and Free Throw shooters Los Angeles Lakers should consider signing in the summer of 2019. I determined best shooters the Lakers should consider based on the player's stats in 2017 season. I imported the list of players that will be free agents in 2019 from the project called, '2019 NBA Free Agents' and made a list of players Lakers should go after in 2019. <br />

## ▣ Web Scraping

**2019 NBA Free Agents**<br />
[Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mirajpatel19/Portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Web%20Scraping/2019%20NBA%20Free%20Agents%20-%20Web%20Scraping.ipynb)<br />
For this project, 2019 NBA Free Agents I wanted to practice my web scrapping skills. I scraped 2019 potential NBA free agents Los Angeles Lakers can potentially sign in the summer of 2019. I scrapped the data from the site 'HoopsHype' and exported the data as comma-separated values(.csv) file to be used in my different project called NBA Stats - Los Angeles Lakers. Please feel free to click on the link above to see how I web scraped the site.<br />

**TMDB Movies**<br />
[Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mirajpatel19/Portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Web%20Scraping/IMDB%20Movies%20-%20Web%20Scraping.ipynb)<br />
For this project, IMDB Movies, I wanted to practice my web scrapping skills using BeautifulSoup. I scraped movies from the year 2000 to 2018. I used the 'IMDb' site to scrap information such as movie names, the year it came out, IMDB ratings, metascore, and the number of votes. Please feel free to click on the link above to see how I web scraped the site.<br />
