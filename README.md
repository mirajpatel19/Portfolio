# Miraj Patel's Portfolio

Here are the projects that I have worked on outside of school and work. Projects below consist of Data Exploration, Web Scraping, Machine Learning, and Tableau.

## Exploratory Analysis

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**TMDB 5000 Movies**<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/mirajpatel19/Portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Data%20Exploratory/IMDB%20Movies%20-%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of this project, 'IMDB Movies' was to perform data exploration and determined what makes a movie 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blockbuster. Along the way, I answer questions that I come across while doing data exploration such as what is average profit for the most profitable movies?, what are the languages of the most profitable movies?, what is average budget for profitable movies?, and what is the average duration of top 5 most profitable movie? In the end, I am able to predict what qualities makes a movie blockbuster. For a movie to be a blockbuster it must have genres as either drama, comedy, thriller, action, or adventure. Some of these casts such as Samuel L. Jackson, Robert De Niro, Bruce Willis, Matt Damon, and Morgan Freeman. The average runtime should be around 111 minutes. The movie must be in these languages: English, Français, Español, Deutsch, and Pусский. The average budget must be around 43 million dollars. It a movie has all of those things, on average the movie will have a profit of around 111 million dollars.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**TED Talks**<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/mirajpatel19/Portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Data%20Exploratory/TED%20Talks%20-%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working on it.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Titanic**<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/mirajpatel19/Portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Data%20Exploratory/Titanic%20-%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary of it. *Fun Fact:Titanic dataset was not the first dataset I actually worked on. Majority of beginner actually start learning on the dataset.*<br />  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**NBA Stats - Los Angeles Lakers**<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/mirajpatel19/Portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Data%20Exploratory/2010-2017%20NBA%20Stats%20Analyzing%20to%20find%20best%20basketball%20shooters%20for%20Los%20Angeles%20Lakers.ipynb)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of this project was to perform data exploration and find best 3-Point and Free Throw shooters Los Angeles Lakers should consider signing in the summer of 2019. I determined best shooters the Lakers should consider based on the player's stats in 2017 season. I imported the list of players that will be free agents in 2019 from the project called, '2019 NBA Free Agents' and made a list of players Lakers should go after in 2019. <br />

## Web Scraping

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**2019 NBA Free Agents**<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/mirajpatel19/Portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Web%20Scraping/2019%20NBA%20Free%20Agents%20-%20Web%20Scraping.ipynb)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this project, 2019 NBA Free Agents I wanted to practice my web scrapping skills. I scraped 2019 potential NBA free agents Los Angeles Lakers can potentially sign in the summer of 2019. I scrapped the data from the site 'HoopsHype' and exported the data as comma-separated values(.csv) file to be used in my different project called NBA Stats - Los Angeles Lakers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**TMDB Movies**<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/mirajpatel19/Portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Web%20Scraping/IMDB%20Movies%20-%20Web%20Scraping.ipynb)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this project, IMDB Movies, I wanted to practice my web scrapping skills using BeautifulSoup. I scraped movies from 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the year 2000 to 2018. I used the 'IMDb' site to scrap information such as movie names, the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year it came out, IMDB ratings, metascore, and the number of votes. Please feel free to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;click on the link above to see how I web scraped the site.<br />
