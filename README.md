Here are the projects that I have worked on outside of school and work. Projects below consist of Data Exploration, Web Scraping, Machine Learning, and Tableau.

## Exploratory Analysis

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**TMDB 5000 Movies**<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/mirajpatel19/Portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Data%20Exploratory/IMDB%20Movies%20-%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of this project, 'IMDB Movies' was to perform data exploration and determined what makes a movie blockbuster. Along the way, I answer 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;questions that I come across while doing data exploration such as what is average profit for the most profitable movies?, what are the languages of the 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;most profitable movies?, what is average budget for profitable movies?, and what is the average duration of top 5 most profitable movie? In the end, I am 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;able to predict what qualities makes a movie blockbuster. For a movie to be a blockbuster it must have genres as either drama, comedy, thriller, action, or 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adventure. Some of these casts such as Samuel L. Jackson, Robert De Niro, Bruce Willis, Matt Damon, and Morgan Freeman. The average runtime 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should be around 111 minutes. The movie must be in these languages: English, Français, Español, Deutsch, and Pусский. The average budget must be 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;around 43 million dollars. It a movie has all of those things, on average the movie will have a profit of around 111 million dollars.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**TED Talks**<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/mirajpatel19/Portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Data%20Exploratory/TED%20Talks%20-%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working on it.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Titanic**<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/mirajpatel19/Portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Data%20Exploratory/Titanic%20-%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary of it. *Fun Fact:Titanic dataset was not the first dataset I actually worked on. Majority of beginner actually start learning on the dataset.*<br />  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**NBA Stats - Los Angeles Lakers**<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/mirajpatel19/Portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Data%20Exploratory/2010-2017%20NBA%20Stats%20Analyzing%20to%20find%20best%20basketball%20shooters%20for%20Los%20Angeles%20Lakers.ipynb)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of this project was to perform data exploration and find best 3-Point and Free Throw shooters Los Angeles Lakers should consider 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;signing in the summer of 2019. I determined best shooters the Lakers should consider based on the player's stats in 2017 season. I imported the list of
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;players that will be free agents in 2019 from the project called, ' 2019 NBA Free Agents' and made a list of players Lakers should go after in 2019. <br />

## Web Scraping

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**2019 NBA Free Agents**<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/mirajpatel19/Portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Web%20Scraping/2019%20NBA%20Free%20Agents%20-%20Web%20Scraping.ipynb)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this project, 2019 NBA Free Agents I wanted to practice my web scrapping skills. I scraped 2019 potential NBA free agents Los Angeles Lakers can 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;potentially sign in the summer of 2019. I scrapped the data from the site 'HoopsHype' and exported the data as comma-separated values(.csv) file to be 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;used in my different project called NBA Stats - Los Angeles Lakers. Please feel free to click on the link above to see how I web scraped the site.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**TMDB Movies**<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/mirajpatel19/Portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Web%20Scraping/IMDB%20Movies%20-%20Web%20Scraping.ipynb)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this project, IMDB Movies, I wanted to practice my web scrapping skills using BeautifulSoup. I scraped movies from the year 2000 to 2018. I used the 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'IMDb' site to scrap information such as movie names, the year it came out, IMDB ratings, metascore, and the number of votes. Please feel free to click on 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the link above to see how I web scraped the site.<br />
