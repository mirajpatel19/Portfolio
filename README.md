# Miraj Patel's Portfolio

Here are the projects that I have worked on outside of school and work. Projects below consist of Data Exploration, Web Scraping, Machine Learning, and Tableau.

## Exploratory Analysis

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**TMDB 5000 Movies**<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mirajpatel19/Portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Data%20Exploratory/IMDB%20Movies%20-%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of this project, 'IMDB Movies' was to perform data exploration and determined what makes a movie 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blockbuster. Along the way, I answer questions that I come across while doing data exploration such as what is average 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;profit for the most profitable movies? what are the languages of the most profitable movies?, what is average budget for 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;profitable movies? and what is the average duration of top 5 most profitable movie? In the end, I am able to predict 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what qualities makes a movie blockbuster. For a movie to be a blockbuster it must have genres as either drama, comedy, 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thriller, action, or adventure. Some of these casts such as Samuel L. Jackson, Robert De Niro, Bruce Willis, Matt Damon, 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Morgan Freeman. The average runtime should be around 111 minutes. The movie must be in these languages: 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;English, Français, Español, Deutsch, and Pусский. The average budget must be around 43 million dollars. It a movie has 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all of those things, on average the movie will have a profit of around 111 million dollars.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**TED Talks**<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mirajpatel19/Portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Data%20Exploratory/TED%20Talks%20-%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my first data exploratory project. I had to learn many new things while working on this project. Big thanks and the 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;credit goes to Rounak Banik for the inspiration. In this project I answer question such as, most funny TED Talks show,  with 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what occupation can you increase you chances of being a TED Talk speaker, most inspiring TED Talks show, is there any 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;correlation between languages and views, what TED Event has the most amount of TED Talks publish on the website, and many 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more. I also Analyze TED talks by years, months, and days.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Titanic**<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mirajpatel19/Portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Data%20Exploratory/Titanic%20-%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary of it. *Fun Fact:Titanic dataset was not the first dataset I actually worked on. Majority of beginner actually start 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;learning on the dataset.*<br />  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**NBA Stats - Los Angeles Lakers**<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mirajpatel19/Portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Data%20Exploratory/NBA%20Stats%20-%20Los%20Angeles%20Lakers.ipynb)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of this project was to perform data exploration and find best 3-Point and Free Throw shooters Los 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angeles Lakers should consider signing in the summer of 2019. I determined best shooters the Lakers should consider 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;based on the player's stats in 2017 season. I imported the list of players that will be free agents in 2019 from the project 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called, '2019 NBA Free Agents' and made a list of players Lakers should go after in 2019. <br />

## Web Scraping

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**2019 NBA Free Agents**<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mirajpatel19/Portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Web%20Scraping/2019%20NBA%20Free%20Agents%20-%20Web%20Scraping.ipynb)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this project, 2019 NBA Free Agents I wanted to practice my web scrapping skills. I scraped 2019 potential NBA free 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agents Los Angeles Lakers can potentially sign in the summer of 2019. I scrapped the data from the site 'HoopsHype' and 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exported the data as comma-separated values(.csv) file to be used in my different project called NBA Stats - Los Angeles 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lakers. Please feel free to click on the link above to see how I web scraped the site.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**TMDB Movies**<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mirajpatel19/Portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Web%20Scraping/IMDB%20Movies%20-%20Web%20Scraping.ipynb)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this project, IMDB Movies, I wanted to practice my web scrapping skills using BeautifulSoup. I scraped movies from 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the year 2000 to 2018. I used the 'IMDb' site to scrap information such as movie names, the year it came out, IMDB 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ratings, metascore, and the number of votes. Please feel free to click on the link above to see how I web scraped the site.<br />
